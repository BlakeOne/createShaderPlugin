Version 1.0.1

createShaderPlugin now works even after the renderer/app has been created, by simply passing renderer as the final parameter. If the renderer/app hasn't been created yet then this parameter can be omitted like before. 

There's now a helper function to create a sprite and add all 3 plugin-related properties at once:
var sprite = createShaderPluginSprite(name, size, uniforms);
